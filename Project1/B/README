Makefile
	
Five targets:

default ... compiles lab1b-server.c into an executable called lab1b-server and
			lab1b-client.c into an executable called lab1b-client. Both are
			compiled with the -Wall and -Wextra options

client ... compiles lab1b-client.c into an executable called lab1b-client with
		   the -Wall and -Wextra options

server ... compiles lab1b-server.c into an executable called lab1b-server with
		   the -Wall and -Wextra options

dist ... makes the distribution tarball

clean ... removes the distribution tarball and the executables compiled by default

lab1b-server.c

Source code for the server program. It will connect to the
client, receive the client's commands and send them to the
shell. It will then "serve" the client the outputs of those
commands. Port specified with the mandatory --port= option.
Supports a --compress option.


lab1b-client.c

Source code for the client program. It will open a connection
to the server with the mandatory --port= option. The client
will send input from the keyboard to the socket (while echoing
it to the display).
