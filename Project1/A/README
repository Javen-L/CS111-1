Project 1a

Files:


lab1a.c

Source code written in C. When run without any options, it puts the 
keyboard into non-canonical input mode with no echo, and reads 
input from the keyboard and writes the received characters back out
to the display.

Supports a --shell option, which forks to create a new process and
then execs a shell (/bin/bash). Reads input from keyboard, echoes
it to output, and forwards it to the shell. Reads input fro the
shell and writes it to output.


Makefile

Supports three targets:

default ... makes the executable file lab1a, uses -Wextra and -Wall

clean ... removes any files created by the Makefile

dist ... makes the distribution tarball


Testing methodology

To test this program, I ran it on the terminal to make sure that 
the input/output was being processed as it was suppsoed to.

For example, I ran ./lab1a --shell and then typed in ls, to make sure
that ls was in fact listing the contents of the current directory.
The sanity check also helped with testing and debugging my code.
